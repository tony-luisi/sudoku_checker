# sudoku_checker

## Purpose
To flex my javascript skills to implement an algorithm that can check if a sudoku board is complete

## Overview
Takes a 2D array of integers (from 1 to 9) and checks if the sudoku board is complete (not empty) and valid

##Stretch
To implement a sudoku solver (which is harder given that it is a non-deterministic polynomial time problem)
